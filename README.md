## Professional experience

**Earth Observation Scientist, Geoscience Australia** / 2018 - current
* Product development, spatial analysis and processing of extremely large remotely-sensed spatiotemporal datasets managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform. Projects include:

    * [NIDEM: a continental digital elevation model of Australia's intertidal zone](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/nidem)
    
**Postdoctoral Researcher, University of New South Wales** / 2017 – 2018
* Development of land use-connectivity network analysis models and modification of US-centric land change simulation models (CHANGE model based on FORE-SCE and LADS) for application to Australia

**GIS and remote sensing demonstrator, School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Science** / 2016
* Instructed on use of Geographical Information Systems software (ArcGIS) and data analysis techniques to 60 students in a post-graduate level university course

**Quality assurance/tester, Intersect Australia Pty Ltd** / 2012 – 2014
* Tested and provided end-user feedback on GIS functionality of the Federated Archaeological Information Management System Project (FAIMS) Android software application

**Geoscience field/research assistant, Tundzha Regional Archaeological Project, Bulgaria** / 2011
* Worked collaboratively with an international team of environmental scientists, GIS specialists and landscape archaeologists, and designed and conducted a multi-disciplinary geoarchaeological project involving extensive field work aimed at studying the paleoenvironmental landscape of an archaeologically significant region of central Bulgaria


## Education

**University of New South Wales** / 2014 – 2017

*Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Geospatial Science*, Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Change Laboratory
* Analysed high-resolution remote sensing datasets to study ecological habitat networks across a major Australian river basin over a 25 year period 
* Used advanced graph theoretic statistics to identify hydroclimatic and land use processes driving spatial and temporal changes in landscape connectivity  
* Conducted the largest spatially explicit ecological network analysis published to date (6.6 million nodes)
